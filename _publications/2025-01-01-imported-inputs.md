excerpt: "I explore to what extent the positive effect that imported inputs has on domestic firm's productivity is accounted by an (indirect) access to foreign contract enforcement institutions. Based on the identifying assumption that customized inputs are affected by contracting frictions but homogeneous inputs are not, I can separately identify this channel from a more broad “quality” effect (foreign inputs are vertically differentiated from domestic ones) by combining a rich microdata from Mexico at the firm-input-source level and a theoretical model of contracting frictions and international trade."
